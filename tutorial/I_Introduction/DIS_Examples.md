# Example DIS Applications

There are a number of example applications of DIS available. This section simply shows a few so the reader can get an idea of what DIS is capable of helping implement. Some of the applicatons shown are commercial.

## MetaVR and VRSG

The company MetaVR has created an application that uses DIS called the Virtual Reality Scene Generator (VRSG). The VRSG application can implement views of terrain, with varying weather, and that includes aircraft. 

[MetaVR](http://www.metavr.com/products/vrsg/vrsgstandalone.html "Title") Has a web page devoted to the Virtual Reality Scene Generator application. Another web site for VRSG is at
[here](http://www.metavr.com/products/vrsg/vrsgoverview.html"Title"), which features vehicles at the Yuma proving grounds and the Strait of Hormuz.

## Battlespace Simulations and Modern Air Combat Environment

This application is put out by Battlespace Simulations, Inc. Their web site is at [MASE](https://www.bssim.com/mace/ "Title") According to company Battlespace Simulations, 

>MACE is a physics-based, many-on-many simulation and threat environment with a large order of battle, ideally suited for both standalone mission rehearsal and distributed mission simulation. MACE provides computer generated forces (CGF), sometimes called semi-autonomous forces (SAF), as well as scenario creation, management and IOS features. Using MACE, you can quickly and easily extend your distributed simulation framework. MACE supports the Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) architecture including simulation management, entity state, fire, detonate and emissions PDUs.

## ACM

The ACM project is a free game that can be used in the debian operating system.

A major web site is at [ACM](https://packages.debian.org/sid/games/acm "Title") 

According to the site, this is

> multiplayer aerial combat simulation. Players engage in air to air combat against one another using heat seeking missiles and cannons.

>Main features include:

> * Simulation with 6 degrees of freedom.
> * Structural limit to the vertical positive/negative load.
> * Classic instruments, navigation and head-up display (HUD).
> * Several aircraft models implemented, both civil and military.
> * Two scenes provided, with many runways and radio stations.

## DISWebGateway

[DISWebGateway](https://github.com/open-dis/DISWebGateway "Title") 


DISWebGateway is a small open-dis project. The application reads native DIS traffic on the network, then forwards it to a web server. The DIS traffic can be interpreted by a Javascript implementation of DIS and used in a variety of ways. Users can visit a site on the server and see the effect.

This can be quite interesting. The server allows access to a huge range of capabilities, including remote web-based data The screen capture below shows an entity mapped by the Google Maps utility. OpenStreetMap is also supported.
