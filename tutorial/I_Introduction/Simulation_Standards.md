# Distributed Interactive Simulation

## Simulation Standards

DIS is not the only standard used by contributors to the Department of Defense or other the defense departments of other nations. The other standards include High Level Architecture (HLA), Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA), and WebLVC. They all perform many of the same operations as DIS, and in fact copy some of the ideas of DIS. 

Each of these protocols is discussed in their own section.
