## Simulation Terminology

There are a number of terms floating around in the simulation world, and that's largely the result of the different purposes to which simulations are put. With DIS, the traditional use was what was called "virtual worlds." Those used 3D computer graphics to display something that resembled a live video feed as closely as possible. Ideally, a viewer of the display could not tell the difference between the 3D graphics application, which displayed a collection of entities whose position and orientation was updated by DIS, and a live video pointed at a live exercise. Of course the computer graphics feed wasn't close to solving this problem in the 1990's, but that was the ultimate goal.

Over time it was realized that DIS could be used to achieve other goals. Everything from purely analytical applications of DIS, which assume that there is no graphical result intended at all, to augmented reality, which has some mix between live video and DIS-related graphics. Furthermore the simulations could include either a single user or a great many networked application elements.

### The Range

The image below shows something about how graphics are used in simulation applications, by how many hosts, for what purpose.
