### Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) 

Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) is another simulation standard. It's a very interesting and powerful technology.

TENA was developed by the US Department of Defense, and was intended to include test and training systems on the range. 

#### TENA Web Site

The [TENA Website](https://www.tena-sda.org/) is maintained by the United States Office of the Secretary of Defense Test Resource Management Center (TRMC), which runs the TENA program. 

#### TENA License

According to wikipedia, 

"The TENA software was developed for use by the United States Government with unlimited rights. The software is provided freely for the purpose of promoting interoperability among United States Department of Defense systems. There are no [International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Traffic_in_Arms_Regulations) or export restrictions in using the TENA middleware and related TENA products at an international site, although any restrictions for user provided object models, software, or documents are the responsibility of the author(s) of those products. Use of the TENA software (source code and binary code) by individuals is permitted only upon acceptance of terms and conditions available at the [TENA web site](https://www.tena-sda.org/) after login."

#### Access

TENA requires an account to download the runtime components, but the TENA organization is open to DoD and DoD vendors. Users who register with TENA can download the runtime software for no charge. Some free implementation software is also available for download. It's strongly suggested that you register at the TENA-sda site.

#### TENA Tutorial

One of the things that makes TENA fascinating and powerful is its simularity to Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA). CORBA is, among other things, a form of remote objects. Use of remote objects often greatly increases programmer productivity.

An introduction to [TENA](https://www.tena-sda.org/display/TENAintro/Documentation) is available.

#### TENA Networking

In addition to the TENA software the DoD supports network implementations at many training and evaluaton sites. This is called Joint Mission Environment Test Capability JMETC. Documents explaining JMETC are available at the TENA web site.
