## IV: DIS Aspects

The description of PDUs in "DIS Messages" (Section III) was somewhat general.  For example it pointed out that the Entity State PDU had coordinates that defined the position of the entity it described, but did not specify what the process was for converting the numbers into an actual position. Likewise for which way the entity pointed, or how to dead reckon the position of an entity between the arrivals of ESPDUs.

The prior section gave you an idea of what was contained in a PDU, but not how to use the field values to accomplish something, or what the assumptions were. This section is a long list of tasks, and how to do them.

### Position
### Entity Type
