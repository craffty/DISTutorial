This uses pandoc to convert .md into other formats, including .epub
format (for eBooks) or HTML. The basic idea is to write sections of
the tutorial in .md files, then combine many .md files into an ebook,
an html web site, a pdf file, and other formats.

Pandoc is at https://pandoc.org/

Pandoc can work with multiple .md files. The idea is to supply an 
in-order list of the .md files; pandoc effectively concatenates them
and then does a conversion. This final result as an in-order list
of .md files as defined in pandoc_MD_order.txt. The file runPandoc.sh then 
gets the in-order list and supplies it to pandoc. 

You can also generate formats such as PDF and HTML. Generating
PDF requires that you have TeX installed (on the mac http://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html).
